The Flow Editor is TestMesh's visual interface for building test workflows. It uses a node-based approach where you connect triggers, actions, and conditions to create complex automation flows.

## Interface Overview

The Flow Editor consists of four main areas:

1. **Canvas** - The central area where you build your flow
2. **Sidebar** - Contains available nodes you can drag onto the canvas
3. **Toolbar** - Actions like Run, Save, and Undo/Redo
4. **Properties Panel** - Configure the selected node

## Node Types

### Triggers

Triggers start your flow execution. Every flow needs at least one trigger.

| Trigger | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Manual** | Run the flow on-demand from the UI or API |
| **Schedule** | Run on a cron schedule |
| **Webhook** | Triggered by incoming HTTP requests |
| **Event** | Triggered by system events |

### Actions

Actions perform operations in your flow:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **HTTP Request** | Make REST API calls |
| **Script** | Execute JavaScript/TypeScript code |
| **Database** | Query databases |
| **Assert** | Validate conditions |
| **Delay** | Wait for a specified duration |

### Control Flow

Control flow nodes manage execution paths:

| Node | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Condition** | Branch based on expressions |
| **Loop** | Iterate over arrays or ranges |
| **Parallel** | Execute branches concurrently |
| **Try/Catch** | Handle errors gracefully |

## Working with Data

### Variables

Access data from previous nodes using the `$` syntax:

```typescript
// Access the response from an HTTP request node
const response = $httpRequest1.data;
const statusCode = $httpRequest1.status;

// Access input parameters
const userId = $input.userId;
```

### Expressions

Use JavaScript expressions in node configurations:

```javascript
// Conditional expression
$httpRequest1.status === 200 && $httpRequest1.data.success

// String interpolation
`Hello, ${$input.name}!`

// Array operations
$fetchUsers.data.users.filter(u => u.active)
```

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip">
  **Keep flows focused** - Each flow should have a single purpose. Create multiple flows for different test scenarios.
</Callout>

1. **Name nodes descriptively** - Use clear names like "Fetch User Profile" instead of "HTTP Request 1"
2. **Add comments** - Right-click nodes to add notes explaining their purpose
3. **Handle errors** - Use Try/Catch nodes for operations that might fail
4. **Use variables** - Store reusable values in flow variables
5. **Test incrementally** - Run partial flows while building to catch issues early

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Cmd/Ctrl + S` | Save flow |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Z` | Undo |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Z` | Redo |
| `Delete` | Delete selected node |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + D` | Duplicate node |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` | Run flow |
| `Space` (hold) | Pan canvas |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Scroll` | Zoom in/out |
