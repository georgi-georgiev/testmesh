This guide will help you install TestMesh and create your first test flow.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** (recommended) or Node.js 20+
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)

## Installation

<Tabs items={["Docker (Recommended)", "Manual"]}>
  <Tab value="Docker (Recommended)">
    The fastest way to get started is with Docker Compose:

    ```bash
    # Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/testmesh.git
    cd testmesh

    # Start all services
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    This starts:
    - **Web UI** on `http://localhost:3000`
    - **API Server** on `http://localhost:8080`
    - **PostgreSQL** database
    - **Redis** for job queues
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Manual">
    For development or custom deployments:

    ```bash
    # Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/testmesh.git
    cd testmesh

    # Install web dependencies
    cd web && pnpm install

    # Install API dependencies
    cd ../api && go mod download

    # Start the development servers
    make dev
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Create Your First Flow

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Open the Flow Editor

    Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and click **"New Flow"** to open the visual flow editor.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Add a Trigger

    Every flow starts with a trigger. Drag a **Manual Trigger** from the sidebar to the canvas. This lets you run the flow on-demand.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Add an Action

    Drag an **HTTP Request** action and connect it to the trigger. Configure it to make a GET request to `https://httpbin.org/get`.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Run the Flow

    Click the **Run** button in the toolbar. You'll see the flow execute in real-time with results displayed in the output panel.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Now that you have TestMesh running:

- Learn about the [Flow Editor](/docs/guides/flow-editor) interface
- Explore available [Plugins](/docs/plugins) for integrations
- Set up [Scheduled Runs](/docs/guides/scheduling) for automated testing
- Check the [API Reference](/docs/api-reference) for programmatic access
