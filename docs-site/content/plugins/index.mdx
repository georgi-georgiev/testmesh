TestMesh's plugin system allows you to extend the platform with custom integrations, actions, and triggers.

## How Plugins Work

Plugins are self-contained packages that add new node types to the flow editor. Each plugin can provide:

- **Actions** - New operations your flows can perform
- **Triggers** - New ways to start flows
- **Connections** - Reusable authentication/configuration for services

## Available Plugins

## Installing Plugins

Plugins can be installed from the TestMesh plugin registry or loaded locally:

### From Registry

```bash
testmesh plugin install @testmesh/plugin-kafka
```

### Local Plugin

```bash
testmesh plugin install ./path/to/my-plugin
```

### Via Docker

Add plugins to your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  testmesh:
    image: testmesh/testmesh:latest
    environment:
      TESTMESH_PLUGINS: "@testmesh/plugin-kafka,@testmesh/plugin-database"
```

## Plugin Configuration

Plugins are configured through **Connections** in the UI:

1. Go to **Settings > Connections**
2. Click **New Connection**
3. Select the plugin type
4. Enter the required configuration
5. Test the connection
6. Save

<Callout type="info">
  Connections can be shared across multiple flows. Update the connection once, and all flows using it will use the new configuration.
</Callout>
